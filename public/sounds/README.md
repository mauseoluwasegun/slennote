# Ambient Sounds for Focus Mode

This directory contains ambient sound files for the Focus Mode feature.

## Required Files

- `rain.mp3` - Rain sounds for concentration
- `forest.mp3` - Forest ambience 
- `ocean.mp3` - Ocean waves
- `coffee.mp3` - Coffee shop atmosphere
- `whitenoise.mp3` - White noise for focus
- `notification.mp3` - Timer notification sound

## Adding Your Own Sounds

You can replace these files with your own ambient sounds. Make sure they:

1. Are in MP3 format
2. Loop seamlessly 
3. Are optimized for web (reasonable file size)
4. Have consistent volume levels

## Note

The current implementation uses placeholder paths. In a production environment, you would need to add actual audio files or integrate with a service like Spotify Web API for ambient sounds.
